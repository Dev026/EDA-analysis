#Housing Dataset EDA Analysis 🏡📊

Welcome to my Housing Dataset EDA Analysis repository! In this code, I've conducted a concise Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Housing Dataset. The analysis includes univariate and bivariate exploration, along with data cleansing. Additionally, I've experimented with some new functions to gain insights and enhance the EDA process.

## Key Points:

- **Dataset**: Housing Dataset
- **Analysis Techniques**: Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- **Data Cleansing**: Handling missing values and data cleaning
- **Exploration**: Experimenting with new functions
- **Objective**: Gain insights and understand the basics of EDA

Feel free to explore the code and gain a quick understanding of how EDA works using this housing dataset. This analysis serves as a practical example for those looking to grasp the fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis.

Happy coding! 🚀
